##  About

This is a lightweight To-Do List application designed to help you manage tasks quickly. You can add, mark as complete, and delete tasks, all with a clean and intuitive UI.

I built this project to practice core web technologies and get comfortable with DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

- Add new tasks dynamically  
- Mark tasks as completed (with a strike-through style)

- Optionally, tasks could persist using Local Storage (if implemented)
